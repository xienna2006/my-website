2. Brew & Batter is a specialized digital platform designed for the modern home-cafe enthusiast. It serves as a comprehensive bridge between professional cafe standards and the home kitchen. The service provides high-definition video tutorials, precise brewing calculators, and artisan pastry recipes, allowing users to recreate a premium cafe experience at a fraction of the cost.
3. For the website's font, I used Segoe UI, Tahoma, and Verdana. This choice ensures fast loading times and a clean, modern look across all operating systems without the need for external font files. I used direct links for photos sourced from Google to handle all visual content. This method allowed for high-quality imagery without local file management. I selected a high-resolution cafe image for the hero background to establish the brand theme. Specific direct links for coffee beans, croissants, and timers were used within the features grid. I also included a professional barista shot in the about section to illustrate the product's mission. For the testimonials, I used individual portrait links to create circular user avatars for social proof.

4. I implemented three primary JavaScript features to enhance the interactivity of the landing page. These are hamburger menu, an interactive sign-up form, and smooth scrolling. The hamburger menu uses a click event to toggle navigation visibility on mobile devices, ensuring a responsive user experience. The sign-up form captures user data and provides instant feedback through a personalized success message without refreshing the page. Finally, the scrolling functionality works with the navigation links to allow users to glide smoothly between different sections of the page.
